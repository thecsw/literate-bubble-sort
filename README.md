# literate-bubble-sort

My attempt at writing CWEB (Literate Programming) for bubble sort visualizer.

Just run `make`, it will make a `sort.pdf` for the source documentation and `sort.c` 
with its executable `sort` that will run a bubble sort visualizer.

This was a lot of fun to write. This readme is quite empty on purpose, so that
you could read more in `sort.pdf`
